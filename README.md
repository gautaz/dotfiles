# dotfiles

A versioned container for my configuration files.

These include configuration for:

- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [readline](https://www.gnu.org/software/readline/)
- [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)
- [ssh](http://www.openssh.com/)

## install

    cd <some-location>
    git clone https://github.com/gautaz/dotfiles.git
    dotfiles/install.sh

## Credits

Many ideas were shamelessly taken from [Oliver Caldwell dotfiles](https://github.com/Olical/dotfiles).
Notably using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as a way to organize and install the dot files.
